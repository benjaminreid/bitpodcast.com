In episode 34 we're looking at CSS variables and some of the features of GitHub, both new and non-existent:

- CSS variables: They're here, but are they safe? [Check out this example](http://codepen.io/wesbos/pen/adQjoY?editors=0110) in FireFox 31+ & Chrome 49+
- GitHub: Why is it so hard to find that repo I stared? Check out [this chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-stars-tagger/aaihhjepepgajmehjdmfkofegfddcabc)
- Jekyll: We really like it, especially [now version 3 is on GitHub](https://github.com/blog/2100-github-pages-now-faster-and-simpler-with-jekyll-3-0). However, it's not perfect
