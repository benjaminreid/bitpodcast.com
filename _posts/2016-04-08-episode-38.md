# Rogue Commits, episode #38

We're talking about the latest feature to hit GitHub as well as some new CMSs, and of course the new Star Wars teaser trailer:

- GitHub commit squashing. You can now combine commits when merging pull requests on, [read all about it](https://github.com/blog/2141-squash-your-commits)
- Simpla has just started it's open beta, I have my reservations though which I discuss with Ben. You can [try it out for yourself for free at simpla.io](https://www.simpla.io/)
- A quick(ish) mention of [GitLab Pages](http://pages.gitlab.io/), which is similar to GitHub Pages but appears to have some more technical features for static site generator fans
- Finally, the Rogue One "a Star Wars Story" teaser trailer has just gone live and we chat about how it looks from these early snippets. [check out the video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wji-BZ0oCwg)
