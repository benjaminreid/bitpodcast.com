We tried really hard to smoothly transition from quite serious development tools to casual chat about games, I think we did pretty well. Topics for this episode were:

- React is just web components, right? If you're interested in figuring React out, take a look at [some examples on CodePen](http://codepen.io/search/pens?q=React&limit=all&type=type-pens)
- Teaching machines to design. We briefly discuss an article by Jon Gold, called ['Taking The Robotos To Design School'](http://www.jon.gold/2016/05/robot-design-school/)
- There's a possible new MacBook Pro on the horizon, as [rumoured on Mac Rumors](http://www.macrumors.com/2016/05/31/macbook-pro-leaked-photos-oled-touch-panel/)
- We attempt to predict a few things at E3, and kinda fail. [Sorry Luke](https://twitter.com/Mr_Luke/status/738460877482041344)
- Uncharted 4 is still awesome, so we chat about it some more. **Spoiler warning**
