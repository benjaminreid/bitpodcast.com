This weeks episode was recorded live at Render! We found a quiet (ish) spot to record half way through day 1 with a special guest and then once we returned home from a long day, recapped the afternoon's talks. Enjoy!

Thanks to all the speakers, everyone at Render and [Simpleweb](http://simpleweb.co.uk/) and [Basekit](http://www.basekit.com/) for sending us there!
