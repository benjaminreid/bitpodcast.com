This week we chat about:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
  - GitHub just posted that you can now [access release data from a repo into the relevant GitHub Pages site](https://github.com/blog/1996-releases-metadata-for-github-pages), meaning your project demo site can display your releases with a few simple liquid tags
  - If you have some time, I highly recommend [checking out the ```site.github``` metadata feature](https://help.github.com/articles/repository-metadata-on-github-pages/) within GitHub Pages
- [Ember](http://emberjs.com/)
  - Also [Glimmer](http://emberjs.com/blog/2015/05/05/glimmer-merging.html), the new rendering engine for Ember
- [Star Wars Battlefront](http://starwars.ea.com/starwars/battlefront)
  - Go check out [the latest trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwWLns7-xN8) if you haven't
  - A [load of factoids](http://www.gamespot.com/gallery/15-essential-facts-you-gotta-know-about-star-wars-/2900-115/) you can read through about the game (I'm really sorry that page is paginated)
