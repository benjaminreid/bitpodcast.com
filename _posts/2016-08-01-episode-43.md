### Good work ethics

We discuss our helpful tips when working, to keep our minds healthy.

- Get stuck, go make a tea
- Get annoyed, go make a tea
- Want a tea, go make a tea
- Just make sure to take breaks, even when you're under pressure to get a lot of work done. Short breaks taken often will keep your mind fresh and not _so_ stressed

### What did you do in the beginning?

Ben and Dave chat about their first experiences in the design & development industry, and what their first contributions were to the web.

Without giving too much away, we mentioned web banners. [They're back!](http://codepen.io/chrisgannon/post/my-first-svg-banner-ad)
