  - Tuts+ course '[Building Websites With BaseKit](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/courses/building-websites-with-basekit)'
- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
- Metal Gear Solid 5 & the [Konami / Kojima break up](http://www.polygon.com/2015/7/14/8958401/the-box-for-metal-gear-solid-5-the-phantom-pain-also-wipes-its)
