Episode 28 is up with 3 main topic we discuss:

- The new [Google logo](https://design.google.com/articles/evolving-the-google-identity/), the thing everyone has been talking about except Ben. Check out this great [video showing the evolution of the logo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olFEpeMwgHk) as well
- The new [Metal Gear Solid game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j198th20wjY) that Ben can't stop talking about
- Our old friend [HTML5](http://html5doctor.com/) which we have a complicated relationship with and couldn't stop talking about
