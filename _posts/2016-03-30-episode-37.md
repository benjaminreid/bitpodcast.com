In our latest episode we're talking about NPM, PSVR and hopefully less acronyms:

- NPM Chaos: [npmjs.com](npmjs.com) fell into chaos, but for only 10 minutes, we explain discuss [what happened](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/141577284765/kik-left-pad-and-npm)
- PSVR: Sony unveils the [retail price for their VR](https://www.playstation.com/en-au/explore/playstation-vr/) peripherals that work in conjunction with the PlayStation 4
- Expanding on our PlayStation discussion, we explore the idea of a rumoured [PlayStation 4.5 on the horizon](http://www.polygon.com/2016/3/28/11317470/sony-ps4-playstation-4k-rumor)
- Finally we end the show with something that might mean the end of that age old question "What platform are you buying X on?", [here's our source material](https://news.xbox.com/2016/03/14/letter-chris-charla-idxbox-updates-gdc/)
