We're back from the holidays. Pretty chunky episode this one:

- [GreenSock](https://greensock.com/): Dave exaplins why GreenSock, or GSAP, is so awesome for web animations and how easy it is to pick up
- [Oculus Rift](https://www.oculus.com/en-us/): We chat about their recently announced pre-order and some of the competition they might be up against this year. Mainly [PlayStation VR](https://www.playstation.com/en-au/explore/ps4/features/playstation-vr/)
- [Star Wars: The Force Awakens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGbxmsDFVnE): We've both seen it, now it's time to chat about. There is a spoiler warning but we don't go into great detail
