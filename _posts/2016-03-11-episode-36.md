It's time for episode #36. Ben's bringing home the bacon today, both in terms of topics and tech!

- After [our last episode](https://bitpodcast.com/2016/02/11/episode-34/), Ben got inspired and decided to create a [Google Chrome extension to save GitHub repos](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-projects/poiangpmficambigkofbojjlpappebln)
- We talk about the recently launched game The Division, and how it might have been hyped up a little too much. [Checkout the latest trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oXSfUzjjV8)
- And finally talks, more specifically lightening talks. Ben encourages me to get into them, after he really enjoyed [his talk at Bristol JS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIBqsXLXmc0). I'm thinking about lightening talks for [Jekyll Conf](http://jekyllconf.com/) & [Bristol Web Perf](http://www.meetup.com/bristolwebperf/)
